# google_MLVision_API
A contribution to the MHacks Hackathon 09/23/2017. This is a multiple question test generator for people from different countries learning different languages. This project was built using Google Cloud's Vision and Translate APIs. This project allows people to generate tests without understanding the language themselves.
